          <small><li>There were different price for some stock codes, however the data did not show any indications as to why. As a result, for the final clean inventory list the unit price was adjusted to be a mean of prices for these products</li>
          <li>There were several miscellaneous stock codes included for things such as "broken packages", 
            "missed", "return". The good descriptions, thankfully, for actual sales items had a trend of being in all caps, 
            but there were some miscellaneous descriptions in all caps as well. To help with cleaning, an all lower case 
            column was created so these unwanted descriptions were less likely to be missed. A handful of bad descriptions 
            remain in data post cleaning as there was a wide variety of miscellaneous desctitions.</li>

            <li>Create an all lower case column so unwanted descriptions are less likely to be mised</li>
            <li>Create a list of found miscellaneous words and characters to filter out of data.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <p class="h6"> Category Creation Process:</p>  
          <ol>
            <li>The first step was to break every description down to just individual words, and then count the occurences of each unique word in this list.</li>
            <li>Then a common word list was created from the words with more than 49 occurences.</li>
            <li>These common words were used to base the categories off.</li>
            <li>The categories are: SETS, Colors, Holidays, Material, Design, Jewelry, Vintage, Household</li>
            <li>Lists were then created containing the words that inspired the categories. These lists were used to display 
                True if a description contained a word in the list for the matching category.</li>
            <li>After that, there was a column created to display True or False if the description contained a common word(words with more than 49 occurences).</li>
            <li>Finally all True and False occurences were converted to (1) and (0) respectively to total for a sum. Sum is used to create MISC categroy for descriptions not falling into any category.</li>
